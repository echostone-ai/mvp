# ElevenLabs Model Update Summary

## Change Made
Updated all voice generation endpoints from various models to use **Eleven Multilingual v2** for maximum accuracy in voice cloning.

## Previous Models Used
- `eleven_turbo_v2_5` (most common)
- `eleven_turbo_v2` (some endpoints)
- `eleven_monolingual_v1` (generate-speech)

## New Model
- **`eleven_multilingual_v2`** - Most accurate model for voice cloning according to ElevenLabs testing

## Files Updated

### Core Voice APIs
- ✅ `src/app/api/voice-stream/route.ts` - Main streaming voice API
- ✅ `src/app/api/voice/route.ts` - Voice replay API
- ✅ `src/app/api/improve-voice-consistency/route.ts` - Voice improvement API

### Voice Configuration Libraries
- ✅ `src/lib/voiceConsistency.ts` - Voice consistency utilities
- ✅ `src/lib/improvedVoiceConfig.ts` - Voice configuration settings
- ✅ `src/lib/voiceProfileService.ts` - Voice profile service
- ✅ `src/lib/hybridVoiceService.ts` - Hybrid voice service (3 instances)
- ✅ `src/lib/emotionalCalibrationService.ts` - Emotional calibration

## Expected Benefits

### 1. **Improved Voice Accuracy**
- Better voice cloning fidelity
- More accurate reproduction of original voice characteristics
- Reduced artifacts and distortions

### 2. **Better Accent Preservation**
- More accurate accent reproduction
- Consistent accent across all segments
- Better handling of regional speech patterns

### 3. **Enhanced Voice Consistency**
- Combined with the voice consistency fixes, this should provide the most accurate and consistent voice experience
- Reduced variation between different segments of the same response

## Technical Details

### Model Comparison
- **Eleven Multilingual v2**: Optimized for voice cloning accuracy, supports multiple languages and accents
- **Eleven Turbo v2.5**: Faster but less accurate for voice cloning
- **Eleven Turbo v2**: Older, less accurate version

### API Impact
- No breaking changes to API interfaces
- Same request/response format
- Potentially slightly slower response times (accuracy vs speed tradeoff)
- May use slightly more ElevenLabs credits per request

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Voice Quality Test**: Compare before/after voice quality with the same text
2. **Accent Consistency**: Test with accented speech to verify preservation
3. **Long Response Test**: Test with long responses to ensure consistency throughout
4. **Multiple Avatar Test**: Test different avatars to ensure improvement across all voices

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the model can be easily reverted by changing `eleven_multilingual_v2` back to `eleven_turbo_v2_5` in the updated files.

## Build Status
✅ **SUCCESS** - All changes compile successfully and are ready for deployment.

The combination of the voice consistency fixes + the more accurate Eleven Multilingual v2 model should provide significantly better voice quality and consistency for all avatar interactions.
