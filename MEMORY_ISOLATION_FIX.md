# Memory Isolation Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the memory isolation issue between avatars.

## Problem

The memory system was not properly isolating memories between different avatars. All avatars for a user were sharing the same memory pool, causing confusion and privacy concerns.

## Solution

1. Added an `avatar_id` column to the `memory_fragments` table to associate memories with specific avatars
2. Updated the memory retrieval and storage logic to filter by `avatar_id`
3. Modified the UI to pass the selected avatar's ID to the memory management component

## Database Schema Update

To apply the database schema update, run the following SQL script:

```sql
-- Add avatar_id column to memory_fragments table if it doesn't exist
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'memory_fragments'
        AND column_name = 'avatar_id'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE memory_fragments ADD COLUMN avatar_id UUID REFERENCES avatar_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
        
        -- Create index for avatar-specific queries
        CREATE INDEX memory_fragments_avatar_id_idx ON memory_fragments (avatar_id);
    END IF;
END $$;
```

You can run this script using the Supabase SQL editor or via the command line:

```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f update-memory-schema.sql
```

## Code Changes

The following components were updated:

1. `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Added avatarId to MemoryManagement component
2. `src/components/MemoryManagement.tsx` - Updated to use avatarId for filtering
3. `src/app/api/memories/route.ts` - Modified to accept and use avatarId parameter
4. `src/lib/memoryService.ts` - Updated all memory operations to filter by avatarId

## Testing

After applying these changes, each avatar should now have its own isolated set of memories. You can verify this by:

1. Creating multiple avatars
2. Adding different memories to each avatar
3. Switching between avatars and confirming that only the relevant memories are displayed

## Future Improvements

1. Add migration scripts to associate existing memories with the correct avatars
2. Enhance the memory UI to show which avatar a memory belongs to
3. Add functionality to transfer or share memories between avatars
