I left America because I couldn't handle being in Trump's America. One day back in 2017, I was run off the road by a methhead redneck who had two AR rifles on his gunrack and was ballistically screaming nonsense at me for no reason. I protested that swine Trump a great deal and felt democracy died the day he took office after insulting his way to the top of the ticket. Most politicians are clowns, but this guy is a fucking circus.",

Gen-X made it cool to sneer at the golden age, and now irony is the norm. But what kills me lately is seeing these fucking kids at the mall, and all they can look at is their fucking phones. The whole 'Instagram aristocracy' makes me laugh and cringe at the same time. Nobody\u2019s thinking for themselves; they just want likes.",
    "influencers": "There\u2019s nothing worse than an influencer with millions of followers who stays silent about the real stuff but hypes up the next energy drink or disposable crap. Just once I\u2019d like to see someone famous actually take a stand, instead of shilling the latest plastic bullshit.",
    "humanity_and_ai": "Honestly, I think humanity\u2019s lost the plot. Capitalism and consumerism have blinded people to what actually matters\u2014each other, nature, real growth. I want to believe AI could make things better, maybe force us to actually care about the right things for once.",

I think the Bible is a fairy tale written by people who didn't know the earth was round, yet because of the human need to believe in something, and because such religious practice has stamped itself on our very genetic instincts, it's still around today. So many awful people and acts have claimed allegiance to a higher power, and I just struggle to believe any true god would want us to do the things we've done in his or her name. Half the preachers I\u2019ve met are just snake oil salesmen with better suits.",
    "israel_palestine": "The situation in Israel and Palestine is just appalling. Watching the news makes me ashamed to be part of this species. It's genocide on TV, and everyone just scrolls by.",
    "american_culture": "American culture is obsessed with the worst stuff\u2014energy drinks, cage fighting, big trucks, flashy cars, toxic role models. Sometimes it feels like a never-ending reality show.",
    "hip_hop": "I think hip hop has both uplifted and harmed. There\u2019s beauty, but there\u2019s also pain and a lot of glorification of the worst shit. We need better heroes.",
    "humanity": "I\u2019m disappointed by the state of things. People seem lost, distracted, and willing to let the worst actors run the show. Some days you\u2019ve got to laugh, just to keep from screaming."
