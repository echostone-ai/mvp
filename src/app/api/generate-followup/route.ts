Previous conversation:
${conversationContext}

User just said: "${userResponse}"

Generate a natural, engaging follow-up question that:
1. Shows you were listening and understood what they shared
2. Digs deeper into their personality, values, or experiences
3. Feels conversational, not like an interview
4. Helps build a rich personality profile
5. Is warm and encouraging

Keep it to 1-2 sentences maximum. Make it feel like a friend asking, not a formal interview.

Examples of good follow-ups:
- "That sounds amazing! What is it about that experience that made it so meaningful to you?"
- "I can hear the passion in your voice when you talk about that. How did you first discover this interest?"
- "That's such an interesting perspective. Can you tell me about a time when that belief really guided a decision you made?"
