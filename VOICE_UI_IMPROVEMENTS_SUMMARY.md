# Voice UI/UX Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Poor UI/UX - Avatar Selection
**Problem:** All improvement tools were shown at once, creating clutter
**Solution:** Created `ImprovedVoiceManagement` component with:
- Clean avatar selection grid
- Selected avatar shows tools in organized tabs
- "Manage" tab for basic voice operations
- "Improve" tab for voice quality fixes
- Clear visual status indicators

### 2. ✅ Authentication Error
**Problem:** "Authentication required" error when using improvement features
**Solution:** Enhanced authentication handling:
- Added session check before API calls
- Improved error messages with specific details
- Added Authorization header support
- Better error handling in both client and server

### Enhanced Authentication

Go to `/avatars/voices` or click "Manage Avatar Voices" from your profile

### 2. Select an Avatar
