# 🚨 URGENT AVATAR SECURITY FIX REQUIRED

## CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED

**Issue**: The `avatar_profiles` table is missing the `user_id` column, which means:
- ❌ All users can see all avatars
- ❌ Users can modify/delete other users' avatars  
- ❌ No user isolation for avatar data

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Add user_id column to avatar_profiles table

Go to your **Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor** and run this SQL:

```sql
-- Add user_id column
ALTER TABLE avatar_profiles 
ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX avatar_profiles_user_id_idx ON avatar_profiles (user_id);

-- Make user_id required for new records
ALTER TABLE avatar_profiles 
ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
```

### Step 2: Enable Row Level Security

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE avatar_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create security policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own avatars" ON avatar_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only create their own avatars" ON avatar_profiles
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only update their own avatars" ON avatar_profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only delete their own avatars" ON avatar_profiles
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 3: Update Application Code

The application code has been updated to include user_id filters in all queries, but the database schema fix is required first.

## Files Updated (Application Level Security)

✅ `src/app/avatars/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter
✅ `src/app/avatars/[avatarId]/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter  
✅ `src/app/test-memory-isolation/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter
✅ `src/app/test-avatar-memories/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter
✅ `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter
✅ `src/app/profile/edit/[section]/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter
✅ `src/app/avatars/voices/page.tsx` - Added user_id filter
✅ `src/components/AvatarSelector.tsx` - Added user_id filter

## Testing After Fix

After applying the database changes, test by:
1. Creating avatars with different user accounts
2. Verifying each user only sees their own avatars
3. Confirming users cannot access other users' avatar URLs directly

## Priority: CRITICAL 🚨

This is a data privacy and security issue that must be fixed immediately.
