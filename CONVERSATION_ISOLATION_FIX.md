# Conversation Isolation Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the conversation isolation issue between avatars.

## Problem

The conversation system was not properly isolating conversations between different avatars. All avatars for a user were sharing the same conversation pool, causing confusion and continuity issues when switching between avatars.

## Solution

1. Added an `avatar_id` column to the `conversations` table to associate conversations with specific avatars
2. Updated the conversation retrieval and storage logic to filter by `avatar_id`
3. Modified the ChatInterface component to pass the selected avatar's ID to the ConversationService

## Database Schema Update

To apply the database schema update, run the following SQL script:

```sql
-- Add avatar_id column to conversations table if it doesn't exist
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'conversations'
        AND column_name = 'avatar_id'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN avatar_id UUID REFERENCES avatar_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
        
        -- Create index for avatar-specific queries
        CREATE INDEX conversations_avatar_id_idx ON conversations (avatar_id);
    END IF;
END $$;
```

You can run this script using the Supabase SQL editor or via the command line:

```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f update-conversation-schema.sql
```

## Code Changes

The following components were updated:

1. `src/lib/conversationService.ts` - Updated to support avatar-specific conversations
2. `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Modified to pass avatarId to ConversationService

## Testing

After applying these changes, each avatar should now have its own isolated conversation history. You can verify this by:

1. Creating multiple avatars
2. Having conversations with each avatar
3. Switching between avatars and confirming that the conversation history is specific to each avatar

## Future Improvements

1. Add migration scripts to associate existing conversations with the correct avatars
2. Enhance the conversation UI to show which avatar a conversation belongs to
3. Add functionality to transfer or share conversations between avatars
