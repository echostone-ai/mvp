# How to Access the Voice Improvement Tool

## Where to Find It

I've added the **VoiceImprovementTool** to two locations in your app:

### 1. Voice Management Page
**URL:** `/avatars/voices`

- Go to your profile
- Click on "Manage Avatar Voices" or navigate to `/avatars/voices`
- You'll see the improvement tool below the avatar table
- It will appear for each avatar that already has a voice trained

### 2. Individual Avatar Page  
**URL:** `/avatars/[avatarId]`

- Go to any specific avatar page (e.g., `/avatars/your-avatar-id`)
- If the avatar has a voice, you'll see the improvement tool in the middle of the page
- It appears between the avatar info and the chat interface

## What the Tool Does

The VoiceImprovementTool provides three improvement options:

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Fix Accent Consistency** - Reduces accent variation (recommended for your issue)
2. **ðŸ‘¤ Improve Voice Similarity** - Makes voice sound more like your original
3. **ðŸ˜Š Natural Expression** - Balances consistency with emotional expression

## How to Use It

1. Navigate to either location above
2. Find your avatar that has voice issues
3. Select "Fix Accent Consistency" (recommended for your problem)
4. Click "âœ¨ Improve Voice Now"
5. Wait for the optimization to complete
6. Test your voice with different phrases

## Quick Access

The fastest way to access it:
1. Go to `/avatars/voices` 
2. Look for the "ðŸ”§ Improve [Avatar Name]'s Voice" section
3. Select your improvement type and click the button

## What It Actually Does

The tool will:
- Update your voice settings to: Stability: 0.90, Similarity: 0.88, Style: 0.12
- Test the voice with sample phrases
- Provide recommendations for further improvement
- Show you the consistency score

This should significantly reduce the accent variation you're experiencing!
