# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EchoStone conversation memory feature enables the digital avatar to maintain long-term conversational context by capturing, storing, and retrieving meaningful conversation fragments from user interactions. This creates a more personalized and human-like experience where the avatar can reference previous conversations naturally, combining stored memories with its built-in personality to provide continuity across sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the avatar to remember meaningful details from our previous conversations, so that I feel like I'm talking to someone who knows me personally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user shares meaningful information during a conversation THEN the system SHALL automatically extract and store memory fragments
2. WHEN a user returns for a subsequent conversation THEN the avatar SHALL reference relevant past memories naturally in responses
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL combine stored memories with the avatar's personality data seamlessly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation memories to be stored securely and privately, so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory fragments are stored THEN they SHALL be associated only with the authenticated user's ID
2. WHEN accessing memories THEN the system SHALL only retrieve fragments belonging to the current user
3. WHEN storing sensitive information THEN the system SHALL ensure data is encrypted and secure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have control over my stored memories, so that I can manage my privacy and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my profile THEN I SHALL be able to see all stored memory fragments
2. WHEN managing memories THEN I SHALL be able to edit or delete individual fragments
3. WHEN requested THEN I SHALL be able to export or completely clear all my memory data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the avatar to retrieve the most relevant memories for our current conversation, so that references feel natural and contextual.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mention a topic THEN the system SHALL retrieve semantically related memory fragments
2. WHEN multiple relevant memories exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most contextually appropriate ones
3. WHEN no relevant memories exist THEN the avatar SHALL respond naturally without forced references

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want memory capture to happen automatically without interrupting the conversation flow, so that the experience feels seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message THEN memory extraction SHALL happen in the background without delays
2. WHEN memory storage fails THEN the conversation SHALL continue normally without errors
3. WHEN processing memories THEN the system SHALL not impact response time significantly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the memory system to integrate with existing EchoStone infrastructure, so that implementation is efficient and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing memory features THEN they SHALL use existing Supabase database infrastructure
2. WHEN processing conversations THEN the system SHALL integrate with current OpenAI API usage
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's pgvector extension for semantic search
