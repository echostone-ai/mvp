# Requirements Document for Legacy Hub

## Introduction

The Legacy Hub is a core feature of EchoStone that enables users to preserve memories and voices as interactive avatars. Each avatar belongs to one Owner (the person whose memories these are) and can be visited by many Viewers (friends, family, etc.). The Legacy Hub provides a structured way for loved ones to contribute memories while ensuring the Owner maintains control over their digital legacy.

## Roles & Permissions

### Owner
- Full control over their Legacy Hub
- Can publish and unpublish the avatar
- Can view and moderate all memories
- Receives and resolves flags on inappropriate content
- Can edit their own profile and avatar settings

### Viewer
- Can view the Owner's profile and memories
- Can add new memories (text, audio, image)
- Can flag any memory for Owner review
- Cannot edit or delete memories (only flag)
