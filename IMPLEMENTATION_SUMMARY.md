# Avatar Memory System Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Created SQL migration for adding avatar support (`avatar-migration.sql`)
   - Added `avatar_profiles` table
   - Added `avatar_id` column to `memory_fragments` table
   - Created necessary indexes for performance
   - Updated the vector search function to filter by avatar ID

2. **Memory Service Updates**
   - Updated `MemoryFragment` interface to include `avatarId`
   - Modified `retrieveRelevantMemories` to accept and use `avatarId`
   - Updated `storeMemoryFragment` to store `avatarId`
   - Enhanced `getEnhancedMemoryContext` to support avatar-specific memories
   - Updated `processAndStoreMemories` to handle `avatarId` in context

3. **Chat API Updates**
   - Modified to accept `avatarId` in request body
   - Updated memory retrieval to use `avatarId`
   - Included `avatarId` in memory storage operations

4. **UI Components**
   - Updated `ChatInterface` to accept and pass `avatarId`
   - Created avatar-specific chat page at `/avatars/[avatarId]`
   - Added avatar management page at `/avatars`
   - Added link to avatars in the account menu

5. **Documentation**
   - Created `AVATAR_SYSTEM.md` with usage instructions
   - Created this implementation summary

## How to Test

1. Run the SQL migration to update your database schema:
   ```
   psql -f avatar-migration.sql
   ```

2. Navigate to `/avatars` to create a new avatar

3. Click on an avatar to chat with it at `/avatars/[avatarId]`

4. Test memory isolation by:
   - Sharing different information with different avatars
   - Verifying that each avatar only recalls information shared with it

## Security Notes

For this prototype, we've kept security loose by:
- Not implementing row-level security policies for avatars
- Not restricting avatar access by user ID

In a production environment, you would want to add proper security measures.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the memory service updates into the main `memoryService.ts` file
2. Add avatar customization features
3. Implement proper security measures
4. Add memory management per avatar
